## Main features:
The most common use is to add a light to a eurorack modular case. **Doesn't support phone charging**

## Build Instructions
The key to this panel is to solder the USB socket directly to the PCB pads, because there's no way any screw mounting can be achieved on a size as small as 2hp.

Look at the pictures below and you'll see how it's soldering:
